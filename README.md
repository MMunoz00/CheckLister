# Overview

This is a command line hangman game, a simple letter by letter word guessing game.

I created this program to learn the Kotlin programming language and to demonstrate my understanding of the language.

# Development Environment

This program was created in Visual Studio Code v1.86.2, on a device running Windows 11 ARM. I required the use of the extensions "Kotlin language", and "vscode-runner", as well as the latest kotlin compiler, v1.9.22, and Java RunTime Environment v8.401 to create and test this program.

This program was written in the Kotlin programming language as it was in February 2024
